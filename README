Overview:
RapidCMS was designed to be very simple to implement. You create your site, as 
you would normally in html, css, and javascript, when you site is complete, you
install the framework, specify what content is editable, and hand the site over
to your client.

From the clients perspective, editing the site is very simple.  They log in and
then surf the site like they normally would.  When they reach the content they
want to change, they click the 'edit' button and edit the content just like 
they were editing with a word processor.

The interface is extremely intuitive and easy to use.

But just because it is simple to use, and lightweight, it has the ability to 
do tremendous things.  Integrated into the code are WordPress style hooks and
actions.  They allow you to create powerful modules to extend the functionality
of RapidCMS.
