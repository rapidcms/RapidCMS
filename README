Overview:

RapidCMS was designed to be very simple to implement. First, create your site as 
you would normally in html, css, and javascript. When the site is complete,
install the framework. Specify what content is editable and replace those blocks,
per the online instructions. Those blocks are now editable by clicking the 'EDIT'
button that appears on the left when you are logged in.

From the clients perspective, editing the site is very simple.  They log in and
then surf the site.  When they reach the content they want to change, they click 
the 'EDIT' button and edit the content just like they were editing with a word 
processor.

The interface is extremely intuitive and easy to use.

The cms may be lightweight and simple to use, but it has the ability to be 
extended to do new do things. Integrated into the code are WordPress style hooks 
and actions. They allow you to create powerful modules to extend the functionality
of RapidCMS.
